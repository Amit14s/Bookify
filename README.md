# Bookify – Book Selling Website (Amazon-Inspired Clone)

Bookify is a fully functional and responsive (desktop-first) book-selling website inspired by Amazon. Built using HTML5 and CSS3, it replicates key UI elements such as navigation bars, product sections, category cards, and a clean content layout.

This project demonstrates my ability to turn design ideas into real, working web pages – without relying on frameworks or libraries.

## Why I Built This

I wanted to test and apply my front-end development skills by building a real-world UI inspired by a global e-commerce platform. I focused on:
- Clean layout structuring
- Component reusability (via CSS classes)
- Responsive thinking (desktop-first layout)
- Building without any external templates

- Amazon-style top navigation bar
- Organized book categories (Fiction, Non-Fiction, Romance, etc.)
- Visually clean book product displays
- Styled login popup using `<details>` and custom CSS
